## RufasCube Game Description
RufasCube is NOT another Rubic's Cube. It's a much easier slider puzzle that is incrementally solvable. A 3x3x3 arrangement of cubelets with the center one missing allows sliding permutations. After a randomization, the goal is to restore the cube to its original configuration based on color and alphabetic hints. Now contains a smaller 2x2x2 cube called "Seven", that is an easier version.

Works on Macs running OS-X and PCs running Windows or GNU/Linux.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Featuring

	* no installation
	* no dependencies
	* simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
	* or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.
-----------------------------------------------------------



## Introduction
Dragging the cursor rotates the cube for a better view angle.

Clicking the cursor on a cubelet adjacent to the empty space will slide it into that empty space.  On laptops you may also hit (return) when the cursor is on the cubelet of choice to select and slide it.  On MacBooks, a 2-finger tap on the touchpad works too.

Zooming can be done with a mousewheel, or a 2-finger drag on MacBooks.

As indicated on screen, (h) will toggle a help screen.

Uses FreeType font rendering & TrueType fonts.





-------------------------------------------
## required for running:
* graphics card & driver that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;
* Windows, GNU/Linux or a Mac running OSX >= 10.13 (sep2017);


## Setup of Rufascube:
-------------------------------------------

Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users see "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".


Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users may type:

* cube32.bat or cube64.bat
or
* seven32.bat or seven64.bat

In other words, there are both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows executables delivered. They all should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users note that this game may be initiated in two ways also.  First, by opening a terminal, navigating to the install-directory, and typing:

* "seven_osx" 
or 
* "cube_osx" 

on the command line.  Second by navigating to the installation directory in Finder and clicking the "seven.app" or "cube.app" icons named "RufasSeven" or "RufasCube".  
Note also that a 2-finger-swipe simulates the mouse wheel on a MacBook.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users type:

* cube_gnu
or
* seven_gnu

But if these do not run on linux, the easiest alternative is to install WINE. The Windows executables will run on linux using wine thusly:

	* wine binw32/cube.exe
	* wine binw32/seven.exe


Windows users note: I suggest that you DO NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux; that mode is not supported]. Simply use the windows version.



## Running Rufascube (3x3x3):
-------------------------------------------

Shuffling the cubelets uses random numbers and is not very efficient. Typically unshuffling is a much more lengthy process than solving, and must be done before making any moves on your own. Solving can be started at any time, and can be stopped whenever you want to try to manually complete the solution.

The primary RGB "skin" is based on an RGB color scheme whereby position along X,Y,Z axis determines RGB-color content.  

The first alternate skin has the appearance of a Rubic's cube when solved, after a preliminary scramble.  The other 3 alternate skins, which do not need scrambling (they are already scrambled) represent an iQube with a totally different goal of transforming the outer surface of the cube from its initial appearance to entirely RED.  In all cases, the lettering will assist you in solving the puzzle.  When solved the layers of letters are in alphabetical order:

-----------
	a b c
	d e f
	g h i
-----------
	j k l
	m . n
	o p q
-----------
	r s t
	u v w
	x y z
-----------


iQubes can initially be a) solidGreen; b) yellow with green dots; c) yellow with red dots.
And they all become solid red when solved.


As indicated on screen, (h) will show a help screen.  

The mousewheel controls zoom.

More options (as indicated by the help screen):

* (t)-key Toggles between the primary RGB colors and the currently selected alternate skin, without resetting puzzle;
* (c)-key Cycles thru 4 alternate skins, but this resets puzzle;
* 1-key, ... 5-key  shuffles the cubelets...1:small-shuffle, 5:maximum-shuffle
* (s)-key single-steps toward a solution at any time;
* (=)-key single-steps toward a solution by undoing the shuffle;
* (i)-key or mousewheel zooms-In;
* (o)-key or mousewheel zooms-Out;
* (r)-key => reset to goal configuration (unscramble);
* (m)-key => mute-toggle of sliding sounds;


The keys (up),(dn),(lf),(rt),(f),(b) are functional but they are only helpful/meaningful when the Coordinate Axes are in "standard" orientation, i.e. +X is rightward, +Y is upward, and +Z is outward(toward viewer):

* (f)-key => +Z (forward)
* (b)-key => -Z (backward)
* (up)-key => +Y
* (dn)-key => -Y
* (lf)-key => -X
* (rt)-key => +X
* (a)-key => toggles Axes


### hint #1
Linux users note: the Windows executable files will likely run under WINE on linux.

### hint #2
You may find it easier to focus your attention on the 2D representation at the side of the screen.

### hint #3
After a shuffle, the #steps to unshuffle shows at bottom of screen. At this point you can press the (s)-key to see the #steps to the live solver solution. If unshuffling is quicker, then continue pressing the (=)-key to unshuffle; otherwise continue pressing the (s)-key to solve.



## Running seven(2x2x2), differences:
-------------------------------------------

This simpler, smaller cube has fewer options.

As indicated on screen, (h) will show a help screen.  The (c) key will toggle between the RGB and Vadasz mode at any time.  Zoom is controlled by the mousewheel, or the zoom keys i/o (In,Out).

More options (as indicated by the help screen):

* 1-key, ... 5-key  shuffles the cubelets;
* (c)-key Cycles thru 2 alternate skins;
* (s)-key single-steps toward a solution at any time;
* (=)-key single-steps toward a solution by undoing the shuffle;
* (i)-key or mousewheel zooms-In;
* (o)-key or mousewheel zooms-Out;
* (m)-key => mute-toggle of sliding sounds;

## what is special about this project?

Uses the Ada programming language and fully modern OpenGL methods with textures, shaders, uniforms, sound and actual TTF-lettering.  Achieving version 3.3 core profile contexts, it compiles and runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS-X systems.  This project serves as a testbed for learning the complexities of modern OpenGL, GLSL, FreeType fonts. It is buildable using GNU-Ada.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  the GLFW binding is custom, a FreeTypeAda binding by Felix Krause, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine, OpenAL-Audio with a custom binding, and an Ada compiler.

The linux-build is among very few modern OpenGL games where a single pre-built executable can run on multiple Linux distros without 3rd party add-ons!

Finally, the new "live" autosolver is quite sophisticated. It allows invocation at any time and can be used to get a few steps closer, or all the way to a solution, no matter the current state. It shuts down whenever you feel more confident and begin making moves on your own. Solutions are quickly found but may not always be minimal.

## Using the build scripts
* systems:  Windows, OSX or GNU/Linux
* a recent Ada compiler;  eg. GNU-Ada...try this source:

https://github.com/alire-project/GNAT-FSF-builds/releases




## Build instructions for RufasCube or Seven:


In the following, the "appName" can be either "cube" or "seven".

The build scripts work for GNU Ada [with its own g++].

-------------------------------------------------------
Windows32 => setpath32.bat + wbuildAll.bat
Windows64 => setpath64.bat + w64buildAll.bat (read ~docs\gnuAdaOnWindows.txt)



-------------------------------------------------------
MacOSX => obuildAll.sh

build script for generating a portable executable that will run on most OS-X platforms whether or not they have non-standard libraries GLFWv3 installed.  I used this to build the executable that I deliver, named cube_osx.  Macs with a recent but standard configuration of OS-X should be able to rebuild using this script after GNU Ada has been installed. (Xcode is not used.) You might need to adjust the PATH environment-variable to reflect your actual installation directory (ocmp.sh).



------------------------------------------------------
GNU/Linux => lbuildAll.sh

utilizes the uncommon relocatable libraries (mainly GLFW) that are delivered in this bundle under ./libs/gnu/.  This is used to build the dynamically-linked [gnu/linux] executable, which should run  whether or not your system has those libraries installed.  This was used to create the executable named cube_gnu.  If it doesn't run on your linux distro, you will have to try to build the executable yourself.  In that case, it is hoped that these scripts will work for you.
As a last resort, you can use wine to run the Windows EXEs:

	wine binw32/cube.exe
	wine binw32/seven.exe

## Acknowledgement:  
In february of 2015 I discovered that RufasCube could be considered a software implementation of a Hungarian "Vadasz" 3x3x3 cube, or another similar puzzle called an iQube, whose goals are an all green or all red outer color.  Peter's Black Hole and Magic Jack are still other incarnations.

For further iqube analysis see:
http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/blackhole.htm

I also discovered that the 2x2x2 cube seems to be a software implementation of a Hungarian "Vadasz" cube.
